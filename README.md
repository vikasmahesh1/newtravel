# NewTravel (Vite + React)

Minimal, clean starter for the NewTravel UI. Includes a small demo, a helper script to send files to OpenAI, and workspace recommendations for AI extensions.

Quickstart (PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3) Build for production
npm run build

# 4) Preview production build
npm run preview
```

Files of interest
- `package.json` — scripts, dependencies, and repository metadata
- `src/` — React source (App component, styles)
- `.vscode/extensions.json` — recommended extensions for the workspace

Notes
- The project uses Vite — dev server runs at http://localhost:5173 by default.
- `.env` is ignored by `.gitignore`; keep API keys out of the repo.
